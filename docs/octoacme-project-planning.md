# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager, Business Analyst, UX/UI Designer)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) - involve full delivery team
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) - include QA Lead input for quality criteria
5. Identify dependencies and integration points - coordinate with DevOps Engineer
6. Create release plan and milestone map - Project Manager, Product Manager

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Planning Checklist
- [ ] Project kickoff held
- [ ] Backlog prioritized and estimated
- [ ] Release timeline and milestones agreed
- [ ] Definition of Done documented
- [ ] Initial test plan / QA approach drafted
- [ ] Design requirements identified (if UX/UI Designer involved)
- [ ] Infrastructure and deployment approach reviewed (with DevOps Engineer)

## Role Handoffs in Planning
- **Product Manager → Business Analyst**: High-level requirements → detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Business Analyst → UX/UI Designer**: User workflows and requirements → design concepts and prototypes
- **UX/UI Designer → Developers**: Design specifications and assets → implementation
- **Product Manager → QA Lead**: Feature requirements → test strategy and test plans
- **Developers → DevOps Engineer**: Application architecture → infrastructure and deployment needs
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates planning sessions and ensures team has clear sprint goals
